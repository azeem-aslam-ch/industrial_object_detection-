Designed as a computer vision tool to identify Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in industrial environments, the "PPE Detection" 
project By means of deep learning and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, this project intends to improve workplace 
safety by means of identification and assurance of correct use of fundamental safety equipment including helmets, safety vests, gloves, 
and safety glasses. This program offers insightful information by identifying PPE presence or absence in real-time video streams or photos, 
therefore supporting a culture of safety and helping to minimise occupational accidents.

Key Features: Real-time Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) detection including helmets, safety vests, gloves, and safety glasses.

accurately and quickly detects using the YOLO object detection method.
For flexible use, supports both stationary pictures and video feeds.
Simple adaptable and expandable for use into several safety monitoring systems.
Designed to provide user-friendly experience by simplicity and effectiveness in mind.

Use:

Clone the repository onto your local computer.
Set up the required dependencies.
Start looking for PPE in video streams or photos running the main script.
As necessary, adjust settings or include into your own safety monitoring systems.
